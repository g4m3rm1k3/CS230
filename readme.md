## Gaming Room Client requirements

**Draw it or Lose it** is a software application, developed at CTS (Creative Technology Solutions) for the client The Gaming Room. The requirements included the abilty to run on any major browser using hi resolution images using a client-server model. The application was built in Java and runs on a server serving images through streams, and game logic in the front end as a single page application making api requests.

## What I did well in this documentation

I think I did well explaining the technologies that would be required for the different platforms. Why we chose the technologies we chose and how we can get functionality on mobile.

## Documents I would revise

I don't think we created all the required docuements, so instead of revising documents, I would write a Business requirements document, and full UML with use case diagrams.

## How the users needs were interpreted

I interpred the users needs based on the information provided in the guidelines. They wanted a secure app that could be served and played from any device. Java was already the chosen language, so we would use streams to serve the images to keep memory usage low. It made sense the the front end would be written in JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3.

## Software Design Approach

The software design approach was to use low memory to serve images. How to render the software on the client and how to store the application on the server. We studied many operating system design choices, as well as storage choices. In the future I would take a similar approach see what langauge will best fit the backend, and what language would fit the front end. I might build a full application in java and send the client a jar file.
